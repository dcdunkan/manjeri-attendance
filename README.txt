refinements needed:
- track who & when attendance marked (attendance history schema)
- figure out loading spinners in forms after submission. (submit state visualization)
- redo navigation bar (fix it and make it sticky, simplify it. try to include it in layouts)
- redis integration in most pages
- add head-titles
- use global stores for global data
- switch to data tables instead of normal tables
- extra verifications for auth in server routes
